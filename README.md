# Kaggle Seizure Prediction

Matlab and python codes for kaggle competition.
The competition was abandoned in the middle because of lack of trust 
in the data (train/test errors).  

The best results up to the 25.10.2016 were obtained spectrum features and 
spectral energy bands entropy with naive bayes classifier on top of that.
